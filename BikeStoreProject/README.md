# Bike Store Project

I assume the role of a data analyst who works for a bicycle retailer with three different locations in the United States. 
I created a comprehensive report of the company's performance over the 2016-2018 period and included all the information management would need to make informed decisions. To create it, I used SQL, Excel and Tableau to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can be used to improve operations.
